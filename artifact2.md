## Artifact 2: Algorithms and Data Structure Narrative

**Artifact Description:**

The artifact selected for category two is a Java slideshow application developed during my CS 250: Software Development Life Cycle course (May 2024 - June 2024). This application serves as a vacation booking tool, presenting a top-five destination list. Each destination listing includes an image, a brief description, image credits, and navigation buttons to move between destinations.

**Justification for Inclusion:**

This Java slideshow application is a valuable addition to my ePortfolio, showcasing my foundational programming skills and demonstrating proficiency in several key areas:

*   **Object-Oriented Principles:** The application's class structure and method utilization demonstrate a solid understanding of object-oriented programming principles.
*   **Event Handling and UI Design:** The implementation incorporates event handling and user interface design using Swing components, highlighting my ability to create interactive and user-friendly applications.
*   **Data Structures:** The effective use of a HashMap for data storage and retrieval demonstrates my understanding of data structure selection and its impact on application performance.
*   **Code Refactoring:** The code has been refactored to enhance readability and maintainability, showcasing my ability to improve code quality.

**Improvements Implemented:**

The artifact was significantly improved through the following enhancements:

*   **Elimination of Redundant Code:** Refactoring the code to use `Map.of()` for map creation, reducing redundant code, and adding meaningful comments improved readability and maintainability.
*   **Data Structure Selection:** Replacing a series of `if-else` statements with a HashMap significantly improved the efficiency and maintainability of the code, demonstrating the importance of choosing appropriate data structures.
*   **Improved Code Structure and Readability:** Consistent formatting, clear naming conventions, and the addition of concise comments enhanced the code's readability, making it easier to understand and modify.

**Course Outcome Alignment:**

The enhancements implemented directly address the following course outcomes:

*   **Course Outcome #2:** *Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.* The well-structured code with clear comments and meaningful variable names represents professional-quality written communication.  The visual output of the slideshow application demonstrates my ability to design and deliver effective visual communication.
*   **Course Outcome #3:** *Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.* The selection of `CardLayout`, HashMap, and Swing components demonstrates careful consideration of appropriate computing solutions and their trade-offs.
*   **Course Outcome #4:** *Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.* The project utilizes modern Java libraries and techniques, such as `Map.of()` and HashMaps, showcasing my ability to use current tools and methods.

**Reflection on the Enhancement Process:**

The process of enhancing this artifact was a valuable learning experience.  The initial code, relying heavily on `if-else` statements, was inefficient and difficult to maintain.  Introducing a HashMap to store image paths and descriptions highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate data structures for efficiency and readability.  This change significantly reduced code redundancy and simplified the process of adding or modifying slides.  Refactoring the code to use `Map.of()` for map creation further demonstrated the value of leveraging modern language features for improved readability and maintainability.

A key challenge was ensuring proper alignment between displayed images and corresponding text.  This required careful consideration of layout managers and UI element positioning.  Through this process, I deepened my understanding of core Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and UI design.  I also learned the importance of code refactoring and the value of choosing the right tools and techniques to improve code quality and maintainability.
