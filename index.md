## Code Review

My approach to the code review involved a structured process of analysis and planning. First, I provided a detailed walkthrough of the existing code's features and functionality, explaining how it worked before any enhancements. This established a clear baseline for understanding the project. Next, I conducted a thorough code analysis, targeting areas for improvement across various aspects, including code structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documentation.  This analysis formed the basis for my planned enhancements. This comprehensive approach ensured that the code review not only served as a plan for improvement but also as a demonstration of my understanding of software development principles and course objectives.
